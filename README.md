NITTC winter poster (school task)
# :sunglasses: Motivation
One of the winter vacation assignments for second-year students at NITTC(Toyota Kosen) is to create an art poster. Students are free to use any method they like, including paints, colored pencils, and photographs.  
However, for busy students, making a poster using paints is a huge burden.  
So I came up with the idea of creating a poster from a single photo by processing the photo and inserting a catchphrase.  

In other words, this is a CUI tool for those who want to have an easy time with their art assignments.

# :art: Usage
1) Clone the repository
2) Run ```poster.py``` in a terminal.
3) Add the fonts and photos you want to use under ```./font``` and ```./img``` respectively.
4) Enter the requested information in the CUI.
5) The poster will be created.

## :warning: Notes
- The image will be resized to 1:âˆš2.  
- If the image size is large, it may take some time to resize. If the process does not finish, please change the image to a vertical one or roughly resize it in advance using GIMP, etc.
